# Calendar

The calendar is specifically for tracking meetings and schedualling new meetings. It uses a data base and SQL commands to create and view records.

At the moment it has 4 main commands:

* creates the table
* adds records
* views the whole table
* views specific records

_the table should not be created if already exists._
_new records cannot be created if they have the same date and time._
